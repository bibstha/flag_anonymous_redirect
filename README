Flag Anonymous Redirect

1. Introduction

Flag Anonymous Redirect is a Drupal Module that complements existing Flag module (version1).
It displays the flag link to anonymous users as well, but instead of actual flagging, it 
redirects them to user/login page.

Flag Anonymous Redirect displays flagging links in both nodeview, teaserview pages as well as
any views.
